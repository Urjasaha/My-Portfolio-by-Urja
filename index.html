      <p id="aboutt"> Hi! My name is Urja and I am 10 years old! I'm a virgo in zodiac signs with my birthday on September 10th. I study in R.N.Podar school, grade 4. My hobbies include coding, art, listening to music (I have no clue if thats a hobby or not.) and reading books! One of my favourite series of books are the Magic Tree House. You can see a few of my drawings and paintings in Favourite stuff section. Scroll more to view more about me!! </p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left"> This is a sand art painting done by....ME! My sister gave me the idea. I did this in September 2020. It was a little difficult at first but I managed. I first got a sand paper and made a rough sketch of a desert. Then I used oil pastels to colour/color. And- That's basically it!

            <p class="text-muted text-left"> Pizza is my new favourite food! It's delicious. Well, the pepperoni one is my favourite. The first time I ever ate it was in 2018 at a Dominos pizza shop. It was scrumpcious! My favourite part was the pepperoni of course. I don't really like to eat the top crust of a pizza though.

            <p class="text-muted text-left"> Well, my favourite song is "What makes you beautiful". I really like it because the main reason is that it has a beautiful (see what i did there?) meaning. I like the tune and how the song goes. I first listened to it with my sister in 2020. I don't really remember which month..

            </h5> 
            <p> Due to COVID one of our vacations were cancled. We were suppose to go to Turkey but failed because of the pandemic. Instead we've been going on various stacations. We went to a hotel called S.T Regis. It was pretty nice. There were lots of events happening. The people there were very friendly and offered to take a picture of us! We also went to another hotel called Westin. It was also lovely having excellent service and polite employees. Although it was pricey. Overall, all our stacations were great!

            <p> On may 5th I had my trial class of WhiteHatjr coding classes. I enjoyed it and decided to take up the course, eventually the first 48 classes came to an end. I didn't want to leave coding just yet. So we took the next 145 class package. We're right now learning to make websites and I'm having as much fun as ever! Yes, it is hard but really fun. I also made a personal coding channel link; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbVh-4eQMv0-Dwg0q1pMiSA.

            <p> Like I said previously, we went on many stacations. We were planning on going to Pune. Although, I'm guessing I was sick. We made our first stop in IKEA where i was feeling tired and cold. After that we went to a nearby hotel to stay for the night. There we discovered I had high fever. We returned home the same night.
